# Quartz Pseudocode

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites.

In particular, Quartz supports transforming your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes into a static website.

Natively, Quartz does not support pseudocode and algorithm rendering as HTML. This plugin makes it easy to make Quartz work with [pseudocode.js](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js) and the Obsidian plugin [obsidian-pseudocode](https://github.com/ytliu74/obsidian-pseudocode).

Thanks to [@truemogician](https://github.com/truemogician) who created a rehype plugin for pseudocode.js which I used as inspiration.
